@comment{This is a bibliography file. It contains all references that will be used in the main .tex file. All references have an entry name, the first argument to the entry, by which the entry will be referred in the main text. ENTRY NAMES CANNOT CONTAIN SPACES. or example, if we want to cite the first entry in this file, we would do something like 'And in \cite{fdrichardson} the authors note that'}

@comment{For all scholarly/academic-type references, the absolute easiest way to populate the fields of each reference is to use Google Scholar. Click the quotation mark under any article/reference on Google Scholar and click on BibTeX to generate the source code that can be directly copied and pasted into the bib file. It's very easy!!}
