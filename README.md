# Fall 2021 Knot Theory Project

This is the latex code and pdf for our final project of **MATH 1410: Topology** with Thomas Goodwillie in Fall 2021. In this writeup, we introduced the fundamentals of Knot Theory and used Van Kampen's Theorem to prove the Wirtlinger presentation of a given knot diagram.
